Check arguments:
	-amount of unsorted args
	-amount of function args

			Skip first index of argv
			Iterate until index is no longer int
			Iterate until index is no longer char *

Allocate memory for stack a and b:
	-amount of unsorted args
	-

Copy int arguments into stack a:
	-amount of unsorted args
	-linked list to store into
	-

Execute function args on unsorted as efficiently as possible:
	-linked list containing all unsorted args
	-list of function args to execute onto linked list containing all unsorted args
	-

Check whether stack is sorted:
	-linked list containing all "sorted" args
	-print "KO" or "OK"
