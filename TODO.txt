NICE TO HAVE:
	Redo sort_five to be most effecient.

TODO:
	Check that biggest and smallest are always next to each other
	set var = last
	Use logic that treats the last and first indeces as next to each other

SORT ALL ALGO LOGIC:
	Do sort_all algo.
		Prep:	3x push to stackb
				Define where we can't push ie. between max and min
						Can't compare a index with the max and min, unless it's smaller/biggest than min/max.

	Find best stackb pos LOGiC:
		while (!(stacka[i] > stackb[j] && stacka[i] < stackb[j+ 1]))
			increment through stack;
		if stackb[j] == smallest_weight and stackb[j + 1] == biggest_weight 

	 


COMPLETED:					
	Fix ft_rrb.
