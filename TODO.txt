NICE TO HAVE:
	Redo sort_five to be most effecient.

COMPLETED:					
	Fix memory leaks.
	Protect against 2147483647 and -2147483648 or bigger/smaller numbers.
	Protect against spaces when passing action to checker ie. "  sa  ".
	"$>./push_swap 0 1 2 3". The program should display nothing (0 instruction)
		-> add a function to check if stack is already sorted.
	Implement ft_rr() and ft_rrr().
	sort() needs to return int to determine whether it passed or failed.
	Norm all code
